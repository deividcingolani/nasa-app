    "FY18 IRTD Developing a Closed-loop, Bioregenerative Water Purification System for Future Planetary Habitats (Zero-G Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor)",

  description:
    "<p>This project worked to solve the critical needs of future space missions to establish planetary bases that require large volumes of water to support astronauts, food generating plants, and key infrastructure including science experiments and thermal cooling systems by combining water purification, wastewater management, and plant production into a closed-loop, bioregenerative wastewater purification system.  A wastewater treatment facility was designed that will (1) process all forms of wastewater – to include all sources of crew-generated waste; (2) fit within architecture designed for the International Space Station (ISS), Gateway, and future Lunar Surface System habitats; and (3) be fully closed-loop requiring no chemical or filter resupply. Trade studies were performed to identify and characterize the input waste streams into the system, the functions required to perform treatment, and the output streams required by end-users. The required processing functions led to the creation of a system architecture though the downselection of optimal processing methods.</p>  <p>The initial subsystem, the Anaerobic Membrane BioReactor (AnMBR), was designed and built at the University of South Florida (USF) to process high concentration blackwater. The AnMBR subsystem breaks down particulate organic matter and large molecules through an anaerobic microbial membrane process. Prototype fabrication of AnMBR was performed under an NSSC contract utilizing USF lab capabilities, including machining and tooling resources with select components made in the USF 3D fabrication lab. The completed AnMBR system was designed to fit into the EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments to the Space Station (EXPRESS) rack aboard the ISS. The EXPRESS rack design can potentially be used aboard a future microgravity flight or tweaked to fit within the Gateway Habitat element.</p>  <p>A Phototrophic Membrane Bioreactor (PMBR) was proposed as the secondary subsystem for the overall ‘closed-loop water purification’ system. The PMBR converts fertilizer compounds from wastewater to algal biomass, providing a source of oxygen, and sink for carbon dioxide. The systems primary goal was to produce a PMBR effluent stream that is suitable for higher order plant growth; this required a reduction of ammonia concentration. Using algae's oxygen production capabilities, the system converted some of the ammonia to nitrate with nitrifying bacteria. In addition to the effluent water stream used for plant growth, the PMBR also produced oxygen and sequesters carbon dioxide. This is currently being measured to quantify the impact of such a system on crew life support and future habitat development. In addition to collecting data on long-term testing, additional investigations are ongoing to further optimize the PMBR.</p>  <p>Future tasks and deliverables are expected under six-year project plan under an Advanced Exploration Systems funded proposal.</p> ",
