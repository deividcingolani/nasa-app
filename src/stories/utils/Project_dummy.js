  description:
    "<p>The AES Autonomous Systems and Operations (ASO) project will develop an understanding of the impacts of increasing communication time delays on mission operations, develop autonomy technologies to mitigate the impacts, and infuse them into Human Exploration and Operations systems. The technologies are expected to reduce operations costs as well. This technology has been tested on ISS in FY14-16 as part of the AES Autonomous Mission Operations project; testing continues in FY19-20 under ASO. This technology has also been tested in the Integrated Power, Avionics and Software (IPAS) facility at JSC, and in a testing facility during Exploration Flight Test 1 (EFT-1); tests continue under ASO with ISS and Orion systems and also target infusion into the Artemis-2 mission.",
  benefits:
    "<p>Currently Funded NASA Missions: This technology has the potential to improve the ability of astronauts to perform activities onboard the International Space Station (ISS) more efficiently, thereby increasing their productivity.</p>  <p>Planned NASA missions: This technology is critical to enable human spaceflight missions beyond Low Earth Orbit.</p>  <p>Commercial Space industry: As new companies begin commercial human space operations, be they tourists in Low Earth Orbit or sending crew to and from the Moon, this technology can provide the same benefits of more efficient operations and increased productivity that it provides to NASA.</p> ",
